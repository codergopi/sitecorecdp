        <p><cite>Pride and&nbsp;Prejudice</cite> is one of the most beloved novels of all time. Elizabeth Bennett, the book&rsquo;s poverty-bound heroine has charmed readers with her wit and sincerity since the book was first published in 1813.  Its hero, the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy, infuriates Elizabeth &mdash; and women readers around the world &mdash; with his rude arrogance, but all fall in love with him anyway.</p>
        <p>A comedy of manners, romance, and neighborhood drama &mdash; it&rsquo;s all there and more.  </p>
