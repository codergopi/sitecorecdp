        <div class="screen-title-details-blurb"><p>NATIONAL BESTSELLER&nbsp;• The most famous true crime novel of all time “chills the blood and exercises the intelligence” (The New York Review of Books) — and haunted its author long after he finished writing it.</p><p> On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues.&nbsp;</p><p> In one of the first non-fiction novels ever written,&nbsp;Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, generating both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. <cite>In Cold&nbsp;Blood</cite> is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.</p></div>
